# MineClone 2
An unofficial Minecraft-like game for Minetest. Forked from MineClone by davedevils.
Developed by Wuzzy and contributors. Not developed or endorsed by Mojang AB.

Version: 0.54.1

### Gameplay
You start in a randomly-generated world made entirely of cubes. You can explore
the world and dig and build almost every block in the world to create new
structures. You can choose to play in a “survival mode” in which you have to
fight monsters and hunger for survival and slowly progress through the
various other aspects of the game, such as mining, farming, building machines, and so on
Or you can play in “creative mode” in which you can build almost anything instantly.

#### Gameplay summary

* Sandbox-style gameplay, no goals (for now)
* Survive: Fight against hostile monsters and hunger
* Mine for ores and other treasures
* Use the collected blocks to create great buildings, your imagination is the limit
* Collect flowers (and other dye sources) and colorize your world
* Find some seeds and start farming
* Find or craft one of hundreds of items
* Build a railway system and have fun with minecarts
* Build complex machines with redstone circuits
* In creative mode you can build almost anything for free and without limits

## How to play (quick start)
### Getting started
* **Punch a tree** trunk until it breaks and collect wood
* Place the **wood into the 2×2 grid** (your “crafting grid” in your inventory menu and craft 4 wood planks
* Place the 4 wood planks in a 2×2 shape in the crafting grid to **make a crafting table**
* **Rightclick the crafting table** for a 3×3 crafting grid to craft more complex things
* Use the **crafting guide** (book icon) to learn all the possible crafting recipes
* **Craft a wooden pickaxe** so you can dig stone
* Different tools break different kinds of blocks. Try them out!
* Continue playing as you wish. Have fun!

### Farming
* Find seeds
* Craft hoe
* Rightclick dirt or similar block with hoe to create farmland
* Place seeds on farmland and watch them grow
* Collect plant when fully grown
* If near water, farmland becomes wet and speeds up growth

### Furnace
* Craft furnace
* Furnace allows you to obtain more items
* Upper slot must contain a smeltable item (example: iron ore)
* Lower slot must contain a fuel item (example: coal)
* See tooltips in crafting guide to learn about fuels and smeltable items

### Additional help
More help about the gameplay, blocks items and much more can be found from inside
the game. You can access the help from your inventory menu.

### Special items
The following items are interesting for Creative Mode and for adventure
map builders. They can not be obtained in-game or in the creative inventory.

* Barrier: `mcl_core:barrier`

Use the `/giveme` chat command to obtain them. See the in-game help for
an explanation.

#### Incomplete items
These items do not work yet, but you can get them with `/giveme` for testing:

* Activator Rail: `mcl_minecarts:activator_rail`
* Minecart with Chest: `mcl_minecarts:chest_minecart`
* Minecart with Furnace: `mcl_minecarts:furnace_minecart`
* Minecart with Hopper: `mcl_minecarts:hopper_minecart`
* Minecart with Command Block: `mcl_minecarts:command_block_minecart`

## Installation
This game requires [Minetest](http://minetest.net) to run (version 5.0.0 or
later). So you need to install Minetest first. Only stable versions of Minetest
are officially supported.
There is no support for running MineClone 2 in development versions of Minetest.

To install MineClone 2 (if you haven't already), move this directory into the
“games” directory of your Minetest data directory. Consult the help of
Minetest to learn more.

## Project description
The main goal of **MineClone 2** is to be a clone of Minecraft and to be released as free software.

* **Target of development: Minecraft, PC Edition, version 1.11** (later known as “Java Edition”)
* Features of later Minecraft versions might sneak in, but they have a low priority
* In general, Minecraft is aimed to be cloned as good as Minetest currently permits (no hacks)
* Cloning the gameplay has highest priority
* MineClone 2 will use different graphics and sounds, but with a similar style
* Cloning the interface has no priority. It will only be roughly imitated
* Limitations found in Minetest will be written down and reported in the course of development

## Completion status
This game is currently in **alpha** stage.
It is playable, but unfinished, many bugs are to be expected.
Backwards-compability is *not* guaranteed, updating your world might cause small and
big bugs (such as “missing node” errors or even crashes).

The following main features are available:

* Tools, weapons
* Armor (unbalanced)
* Crafting system: 2×2 grid, crafting table (3×3 grid), furnace, including a crafting guide
* Chests, large chests, ender chests, shulker boxes
* Furnaces, hoppers
* Hunger
* Most monsters and animals
* All ores from Minecraft
* Most blocks in the overworld
* Water and lava
* Weather
* 28 biomes
* The Nether, a fiery underworld in another dimension
* Redstone circuits (partially)
* Minecarts (partial)
* Boats
* Fire
* Buidling blocks: Stairs, slabs, doors, trapdoors, fences, fence gates, walls
* Clock
* Compass
* Sponge
* Slime block (does not interact with redstone)
* Small plants and saplings
* Dyes
* Banners
* Deco blocks: Glass, stained glass, glass panes, iron bars, hardened clay (and colors), heads and more
* Item frames
* Jukeboxes
* Beds
* Inventory menu
* Creative inventory
* Farming
* Writable books
* A few server commands
* And more!

The following features are incomplete:

* Some monsters and animals
* Redstone-related things
* The End
* Enchanting
* Experience
* Status effects

Bonus features (not found in Minecraft 1.11):

* Built-in crafting guide which shows you crafting and smelting recipes
* In-game help system containing extensive help about gameplay basics, blocks, items and more
* Temporary crafting recipes. They only exist to make some otherwise unaccessible items available when you're not in creative mode. These recipes will be removed as development goes on an more features become available
* Saplings in chests in mapgen v6
* Fully moddable (thanks to Minetest's powerful Lua API)
* New blocks and items:
    * Lookup tool, shows you the help for whatever it touches
    * More slabs and stairs
    * Nether Brick Fence Gate
    * Red Nether Brick Fence
    * Red Nether Brick Fence Gate

Technical differences from Minecraft:

* Height limit of ca. 31000 blocks (much higher than in Minecraft)
* Horizontal world size is ca. 62000×62000 blocks (much smaller than in Minecraft, but it is still very large)
* Still very incomplete and buggy
* Blocks, items, enemies and other features are missing
* A few items have slightly different names to make them easier to distinguish
* Different music for jukebox
* Different textures (Pixel Perfection)
* Different sounds (various sources)
* Different engine (Minetest)

… and finally, MineClone 2 is free software (“free” as in “freedom”)!
