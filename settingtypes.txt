# If enabled, the “flat” map generator generates a Classic Superflat world:
# Completely flat, 1 layer of grass blocks on top of 2 layers of dirt on
# top of a final layer of bedrock. No caves, trees or plants.
# Also, if enabled, the setting “mgflat_flags” is ignored.
# If disabled, Minetest's default flat map generator is used, that is, trees,
# caves, and a deeper underground can be generated.
#
# Caution: Change this setting with care!
# If you change this setting, then play on an existing flat world
# that started with a different setting (e.g. you changed from superflat
# from “enabled” to “disabled”), there will be continuity errors when players
# reach new areas. Most importantly, the void is much higher in Superflat than
# in “normal” Flat.
# But creating new flat worlds after changing this setting should be safe.
