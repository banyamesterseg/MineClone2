## Groups
This document explains all the groups used in this game.

### Special groups

* `not_in_creative_inventory=1`: Item will not be shown in creative inventory
* `not_in_craft_guide=1`: Item will not be shown as result or fuel item in crafting guide (but still may be shown as ingredient)

### Digging time groups

The basic digging time groups determine by which tools a node can be dug.

* `pickaxey`: Diggable by pickaxe. The rating is for the possible tool materials in which the node will make its useful drop:
    * `pickaxey=1`: Wood, gold, stone, iron and diamond
    * `pickaxey=2`: Gold, stone, iron and diamond
    * `pickaxey=3`: Stone, iron and diamond
    * `pickaxey=4`: Iron and diamond
    * `pickaxey=5`: Diamond
* `axey`: Axe. Rating is same as for `pickaxey`
* `shovely`: Shovel. Rating is same as for `pickaxey`
* `swordy=1`: Diggable by sword (any material), and this node is *not* a cobweb
* `swordy_cobweb=1`: Diggable by sword (any material), and this node is a cobweb
* `shearsy=1`: Diggable by shears, and this node is *not* wool
* `shearsy=wool=1`: Diggable by shears, and this node is wool
* `handy=1`: Breakable by hand and this node gives it useful drop when dug by hand. All nodes which are breakable by pickaxe, axe, shovel, sword or shears are also automatically breakable by hand, but not neccess
* `creative_breakable=1`: Block is breakable by hand in creative mode. This group is implied if the node belongs to any other digging group

Please read <http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Breaking> to learn how digging times work in Minecraft, as MineClone 2 is based on the same system.

### Groups for interactions

* `crush_after_fall=1`: For falling nodes. These will crush whatever they hit after falling, not dropping as an item
* `falling_node_damage=1`: For falling nodes. Hurts any objects it hits while falling. Damage is based on anvils
* `dig_by_water=1`: Blocks with this group will drop when they are near flowing water
* `destroy_by_lava_flow=1`: Blocks with this group will be destroyed by flowing lava

* `cultivatable=1`: Block will be turned into Dirt by using a hoe on it
* `flammable`: Block helps spreading fire and gets destroyed by nearby fire (rating doesn't matter)
* `spreading_dirt_type=1`: A dirt-type block with a cover (e.g. grass) which may spread to neighbor dirt blocks
* `dirtifies_below_solid=1`: This node turns into dirt immediately when a solid or dirtifier node is placed on top
* `dirtifier=1`: This node turns nodes the above group into dirt when placed above
* `non_mycelium_plant=1`: A plant which can't grow on mycelium. Placing it on mycelium fails and if mycelium spreads below it, it uproots

* `soil_sapling=2`: Soil for saplings. Intended to be natural soil. All saplings will grow on this

* `destroys_items=1`: If an item happens to be *inside* this node, the item will be destroyed
* `no_eat_delay=1`: Only for foodstuffs. When eating this, all eating delays are ignored.
* `can_eat_when_full=1`: Only for foodstuffs. This item can be eaten when the user has a full hunger bar
* `attached_node_facedir=1`: Like `attached_node`, but for facedir nodes
* `cauldron`: Cauldron. 1: Empty. 2-4: Water height
* `anvil`: Anvil. 1: No damage. 2-3: Higher damage levels
* `no_rename=1`: Item cannot be renamed by anvil
* `comparator_signal=X`: If set, this node outputs a constant (!) comparator signal output of strength X.
* `piston=X`: Piston (main body) (1 = normal, 2 = sticky)
* `piston_pusher=X`: Piston pusher (1 = normal, 2 = sticky)
* `hopper=X`: Hopper (1 = downwards, 2 = sideways)
* `portal=1`: Portal (node that teleports players and things by standing inside)
* `end_portal_frame=X`: End portal frame (1 = no eye, 2 = with eye)

#### Footnotes

1. Normally, all walkable blocks with the default 1×1×1 cube as a collision box (e.g. sand,
   gravel, stone, but not fences) will damage the players while their head is inside. This
   is called “suffocation”. Setting this group disables this behaviour

### Groups (mostly) used for crafting recipes

* `sand=1`: Sand (any color)
* `sandstone=1`: Sandstone (any color) and related nodes (chiseled and the like) (only full blocks)
* `normal_sandstone=1`: “Normal” (yellow) sandstone and related nodes (chiseled and the like) (only full blocks)

* `carpet=1:` (Wool) carpet

* `water_bucket=1`: Bucket containing a liquid of group “water”

### Material groups

These groups correspond to the Minecraft materials. They classify the block into a type, indicating what the block is “made off”.

* `material_stone=1`: Stone
* `material_wood=1`: Wood
* `material_sand=1`: Sand
* `material_glass=1`: Glass

Currently, these groups are used for the note block.
Note that not all Minecraft materials are used so far. More Minecraft materials will lilely only be added when they are needed for a concrete use case.

### Declarative groups
These groups are used mostly for informational purposes

* `solid=1`: Solid full-cube block (automatically assigned)
* `opaque=1`: Opaque block (automatically assigned)
* `not_solid=1`: Block is not solid (only assign this group for nodes which are automatically detected as “solid” in error

   * `container=4`: Furnace-like, has lists `"src"`, `"fuel"` and `"dst"`.
                    It is expected that this also reacts on `on_timer`;
                    the node timer must be started from other mods when they add into `"src"` or `"fuel"`
   * `container=5`: Left part of a 2-part horizontal connected container. Both parts have a `"main"` inventory
                    list. Both inventories are considered to belong together. This is used for large chests.

* `building_block=1`: Block is a building block
* `deco_block=1`: Block is a decorational block

## Fake item groups
These groups put similar items together which should all be treated by the gameplay or the GUI as a single item.
You should not add custom items to these groups for no good reason, this is likely to cause a ton of conflicts.

* `clock`: Clock (rating indicates the “frame”)
* `compass`: Compass (rating indicates the “frame”)

This has the following implication: If you want to use a compass or clock in a crafting recipe, you *must*
use `group:compass` or `group:clock`, respectively.
